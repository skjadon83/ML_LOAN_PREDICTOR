### Step 1: Create a New Workspace

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**.
2. **Create a New Folder**:
   - Go to `File` > `Open Folder...`.
   - Create a new folder named `LoanDefaultPrediction` (or any name you prefer) and open it.

3. **Create a Workspace**:
   - Go to `File` > `Save Workspace As...`.
   - Save the workspace as `LoanDefaultPrediction.code-workspace` in the `LoanDefaultPrediction` folder.

### Step 2: Organize Project Structure

Inside the `LoanDefaultPrediction` folder, create the following subfolders and files:

```
LoanDefaultPrediction/
│
├── data/
│   ├── loan_data.csv
│   └── data_dictionary.csv
│
├── notebooks/
│   └── exploratory_analysis.ipynb
│
├── src/
│   ├── data_preprocessing.py
│   ├── model_training.py
│   └── model_evaluation.py
│
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

### Step 3: Create the Dataset

You can create a sample dataset for loan default prediction. Here’s an example of what the `loan_data.csv` file might look like:

```csv
loan_id,loan_amount,term,interest_rate,credit_score,income,default
1,5000,36,15.0,700,60000,0
2,3000,24,10.0,650,45000,1
3,15000,60,20.0,720,80000,0
4,20000,36,18.0,580,30000,1
5,10000,48,12.0,690,70000,0
```

### Step 4: Create a Data Dictionary

Create a `data_dictionary.md` file in the `data` folder to describe the dataset. Here’s an example of what it might contain:

```markdown
# Data Dictionary for Loan Default Prediction

| Column Name       | Description                                           | Data Type |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| loan_id           | Unique identifier for each loan                       | Integer   |
| loan_amount       | The total amount of the loan                          | Float     |
| term              | The duration of the loan in months                    | Integer   |
| interest_rate     | The interest rate of the loan                          | Float     |
| credit_score      | The credit score of the borrower                      | Integer   |
| income            | The annual income of the borrower                     | Float     |
| default           | Target variable indicating if the loan defaulted (1) or not (0) | Integer   |
```

### Step 5: Create Other Files

1. **`requirements.txt`**: List the necessary Python packages for your project. For example:
   ```
   pandas
   numpy
   scikit-learn
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   jupyter
   ```

2. **`README.md`**: Provide an overview of your project, including its purpose, how to set it up, and how to run the code.

### Step 6: Open the Workspace

1. Go to `File` > `Open Workspace...` and select the `LoanDefaultPrediction.code-workspace` file you created.
2. You should now see your project structure in the Explorer pane.

### Conclusion

You have successfully created a new workspace in Visual Studio Code for your loan default prediction project. You can now start adding your code, performing exploratory data analysis, and building your predictive models.
